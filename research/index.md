I work with Prof. Rachel Slaybaugh from the Nuclear Engineering department and
Prof. Phil Collela from Computer Science. My research interests include
computational geometry, 3D modeling, numerical partial differential equations,
high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, and radiation transport.
